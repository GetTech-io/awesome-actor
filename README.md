## Frameworks, Libraries and Tools

### Application Frameworks

- [Actix](https://github.com/actix/actix) Actor framework for Rust
- [Akka](https://github.com/akka/akka) Build highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications on the JVM [akka.io](https://akka.io)  
- [Akka.Net](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net) Akka.NET is a professional-grade port of the popular Java/Scala framework Akka distributed actor framework to .NET. [getakka.net](https://getakka.net/)  
- [Comedy](https://github.com/untu/comedy) Node.js actor framework.
- [Microsoft Orleans](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans) Orleans is a cross-platform framework for building robust, scalable distributed applications  
- [Microsoft Service Fabric Reliable Actors](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric-services-and-actors-dotnet) Reliable Actors is a Service Fabric application framework based on the Virtual Actor pattern. The Reliable Actors API provides a single-threaded programming model built on the scalability and reliability guarantees provided by Service Fabric. [Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction), [Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction)  
- [Microsoft Dapr Actors](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/concepts/actor/actor_overview.md) Dapr runtime provides an actor implementation which is based on Virtual Actor pattern. The Dapr actors API provides a single-threaded programming model leveraging the scalability and reliability guarantees provided by underlying platform on which Dapr is running. [Dapr](https://github.com/dapr/dapr)  
- [Orbit](https://github.com/orbit/orbit) Distributed systems framework for the JVM by @electronicarts. [www.orbit.cloud](http://www.orbit.cloud)  
- [ProtoActor](https://github.com/AsynkronIT) Ultra fast distributed actors for Go, C# and Java/Kotlin [proto.actor](http://proto.actor)  
- [Riker](https://github.com/riker-rs/riker/) Easily build efficient, highly concurrent and resilient applications. An Actor Framework for Rust. [riker.rs](https://riker.rs)  
- [Rotor](https://github.com/basiliscos/cpp-rotor) Event loop friendly C++ actor micro-framework  
- [SObjectizer](https://github.com/Stiffstream/sobjectizer) SObjectizer is one of a few cross-platform and OpenSource "actor frameworks" for C++. But SObjectizer supports not only Actor Model, but also Publish-Subscribe Model and CSP-like channels. The goal of SObjectizer is significant simplification of development of concurrent and multithreaded applications in C++.
